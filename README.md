This is a partner project on Simple Shell. The shell is a crucial feature of the UNIX(and unix like) system,providing ease for effective communication and interaction between softwares and operating systems. This is possible via structured command lines entered through the shell. Here, Obuji and Janet will be building their own shell on C. Feel free to peruse the associated files, as we take you on a ride on Shell. Thanks.
